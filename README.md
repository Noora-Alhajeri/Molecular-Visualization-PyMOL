# Molecular-Visualization-PyMOL

## Overview

**Molecular modeling and structural visualization** using **PyMOL**, an open-source molecular visualization tool. The goal was to analyze and represent the structure of the **Histone protein (PDB: 6KIX)** and develop a **movie** highlighting key structural elements and interactions in a clear, educational format.


## Tools & Techniques Used

- **Software**: PyMOL Molecular Graphics System
- **Input**: Protein Data Bank File ‚Äì `6KIX.pdb`
- **Scripting**: PyMOL commands and session management
- **Movie Creation**: Scene setting, rendering, and frame transitions
- **File Formats**: `.pml`, `.pse`, `.mp4`



- Load and visualize the Histone protein structure from the Protein Data Bank.
- Create custom **selections** of secondary structure components:
  - **Alpha helices**
  - **Beta sheets**
  - **DNA strands**
- Generate and render a **PyMOL movie** with multiple scenes, each representing a specific biological insight.



The generated movie includes the following scenes:

1. **Alpha Helices**  
   Visualize only the alpha helices of the Histone protein.

2. **Alpha Helices with Polar Contacts & Hydrogen Bonds**  
   Adjusted transparency to show backbone and highlight hydrogen bonds.

3. **Beta Sheets with Polar Contacts**  
   Focused orientation and polar interactions highlighted.

4. **DNA Double Helix**  
   DNA strands extracted and emphasized.

5. **Full Molecule ‚Äì Publication Mode**  
   Enhanced visuals using publication-style rendering.

6. **DNA Wrapped Around Histone Core**  
   The full protein-DNA complex, showcasing the DNA wrapping mechanism.



- Extra attention was paid to **polar interactions**, **visual clarity**, and **aesthetic transitions** between scenes.
- Custom colors and transparency settings were applied for educational emphasis.
- Movie rendering was optimized for smooth transitions and clear molecular presentation.


You can find the generated movie and snapshots in the `media/` folder .
